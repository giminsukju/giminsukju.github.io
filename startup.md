## StartUps


### 1. Granted


### 2. Transcelestial Internship
Transcelestial is a fast-growing startup working on wireless laser communication not just on the ground but also in space. This was my first internship in Singapore. It was exciting and rewarding three months to work on various aspects of their product, from software to hardware. Firstly, I improved the algorithm used to adjust laser alignments by analyzing the mathematical model of laser beam profile and statistical significance of alignment failure cases. In results, the alignment accuracy was improved from 10cm to 1cm. Secondly, I implemented a simulation in Python that can investigate the laser lifetime using the theoretical relation between laser power and laser lifetime and taking the actual weather data measurements. The simulation helped the company’s electronics team select final laser models. Thirdly, I constructed a jig for testing motor friction using an encoder, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi. Using the jig, the defect rate of motors shipped from China dropped from 80% to 1%! Lastly, I created a new damper and mount model in SOLIDWORKS, which greatly improved the usability and reduced the manufacturing costs. The photo is when I was eating the ice cream with the best view in Singapore after testing the laser alignment on a rooftop.


### 3. Flytrex Internship
Flytrex is an Israeli startup and it is one of the pioneers of a drone-based delivery service targeting suburban consumers. My six months in Israel was eye-opening every day, especially with Flytrex. I worked on the drone management server by implementing a user management system, API authentication system, and drone status tracking system. Additionally, I implemented customized data analysis tools for the company’s field testing team. I was constantly exposed to quickly developing tech scenes and learned how to quickly adapt to various tools, such as Tornado, Docker, Sqlalchemy, AWS ECS, ELK, and ArcGIS.
